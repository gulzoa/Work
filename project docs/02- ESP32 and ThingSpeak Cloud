Outline for the ESP32 and Thingspeak Project.

The primary focus of our Cloud Based Cold Chain for Consumer Milk Supply is to propose
an alternate and IOT based solution for the existing outdated system of milk management
in Pakistan. Our solution seeks to offer monitoring and managing the cold supply chain of
milk supply through a cloud management system. This is an utmost need to ensure safe and
unspoiled milk for the people of Pakistan. Since consumption of milk has been a necessary
intake of millions of people of Pakistan for decades [4].
Apart from this, the portion that milk industry has in Pakistan’s overall GDP is also sig
nificant to note here. It is consumed in quantities of billion litres through out the year by
the population [5]. Our project hence suggests a effective, easy to understand and manage
cloud based cold chain system through cloud management software. This is made possible
by monitoring some of the key parameters during the cold chain such as temperature of the
milk container and GPS location.
Therefore this allows the milk farms and consumers to monitor the chain of the milk supply,
as it reaches them from the farm. It would also make sure that the cold supply chain for milk
supply has the required temperature range. Being a key aspect for monitoring which is often
ignored in traditional supply chains
